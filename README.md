# [JSL09] Submission: Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension

# Project Overview

- In this project I created a Personal Dashboard for my Chrome Browser. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dashboard that displays the current time, weather, and news. The project mainly focuses on JavaScript and the use of APIs and how to implement promise rejections.

# Elements Included

- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery

- There aren't any areas of mastery in this project as promises were new to me and it was my first time using them.

## Challenges faced

- Getting my weather information to display. I struggled to get my current location only to realize later that I blocked my location and didn't give the site access to display it.

## Areas of Improvement

- Integrating APIs into a project using promises and .fetch() method.

# Overall Learning Experience

- I would say that it was an interesting project. I learned a lot about how to use APIs and how to implement them in a project. I got to also learn how to use Promises and the Fetch API to make asynchronous requests and handle responses. It was a great learning experience and I am looking forward to learning more about APIs and how to use them in my future projects. It might've been hard/challenging but I'm going to give myself the time to learn more about the fetch, .then() .catch() methods.
